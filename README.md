# Myostatin (GDF-8) Research & Web Project

This repository hosts a full multi-page educational website on **Myostatin**, a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass and a critical component of the TGF-Œ≤ signaling network.

## üåç Overview
The project explains Myostatin‚Äôs biological role, its activation and deactivation mechanisms, and how targeted inhibition can lead to therapeutic and performance-enhancing effects. It dives from **basic molecular biology** to **advanced translational medicine**, covering:

- **Structure & Signaling:** Myostatin‚ÄìActRII‚ÄìSMAD2/3 pathway  
- **Regulation:** Genetic and post-translational control  
- **Inhibition Strategies:** Antibodies, gene editing (CRISPR-Cas9), RNAi, and Follistatin analogs  
- **Therapeutic Applications:** Muscle dystrophy, sarcopenia, cachexia, and more  
- **Frontiers:** Space biology, transhumanism, and athletic gene engineering  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details
Built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript** ‚Äî no external frameworks required. Designed for responsiveness and offline use (local hosting).
